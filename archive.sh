# Build a Release archive of Track.app, export an IPA, and (optionally)
# push it to App Store Connect for TestFlight distribution.
#
# Required env:
#   DEVELOPMENT_TEAM    Apple Developer Team ID (10-char alphanumeric).
#                       The team must already host the
#                       com.pingolin.track bundle id with App Attest,
#                       Push, Associated Domains, App Groups, and
#                       Keychain Sharing capabilities enabled.
#
# Optional env:
#   CONFIGURATION       Build configuration to archive (default: Release).
#                       `ReleaseDev` compiles the DEVELOPMENT hosts into an
#                       otherwise identical distribution-signed build, for
#                       TestFlight builds against that environment.
#   BUILD_NUMBER        Overrides CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION for this archive.
#                       App Store Connect rejects a build number it has
#                       already seen for the same version, so a re-upload
#                       of the same commit needs a higher one here.
#
# Optional env (if any are set, all three are required → archive
# uploads to App Store Connect; otherwise the script stops at IPA):
#   ASC_KEY_ID          App Store Connect API key id
#                       (Users + Access → Keys in App Store Connect)
#   ASC_ISSUER_ID       Issuer id (same page)
#   ASC_KEY_PATH        Path to the AuthKey_<KEY_ID>.p8 file
#                       (downloaded once, can't be re-downloaded)
#
# Usage:
#   DEVELOPMENT_TEAM=ABCDE12345 ./archive.sh
#   DEVELOPMENT_TEAM=ABCDE12345 \
#     ASC_KEY_ID=XXXXXXXXXX ASC_ISSUER_ID=00000000-... \
#     ASC_KEY_PATH=~/.appstoreconnect/AuthKey_XXXXXXXXXX.p8 \
#     ./archive.sh
#
# Outputs are written under ./build/:
#   build/Track.xcarchive    archive bundle (debug-symbols included)
#   build/export/Track.ipa   signed IPA ready for TestFlight
#   build/exportOptions.plist  the materialized export options used

Archive done; upload skipped (no ASC_* env vars).
To push to TestFlight manually:
  - Open Xcode → Window → Organizer → Archives, select this archive,
    click Distribute App → App Store Connect.
  - Or rerun this script with ASC_KEY_ID, ASC_ISSUER_ID, and
    ASC_KEY_PATH set; the .p8 must be the one downloaded from
    App Store Connect → Users + Access → Keys.
