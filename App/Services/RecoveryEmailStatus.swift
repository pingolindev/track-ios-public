/// password-reset link when the primary inbox is gone. It is worth nothing
/// unless it is set up BEFORE the lockout, which is why a phone-first user has
/// to be able to find it from the app, not only in the account portal.
///
/// This type reports state and nothing else. Everything that CREATES, VERIFIES,
/// REMOVES or CONSUMES a recovery address stays in the portal's single
/// implementation, and this app links out to it. That is deliberate: recovery
/// is subtle (a padding or SRP identity-binding mistake there can lock an
/// account out for good), and a second implementation is a second place for
/// such a mistake to hide, in the one flow where the failure mode is "cannot
/// get back in".
